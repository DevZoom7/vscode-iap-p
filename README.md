## Important Note

I made this extension just for **me**, so make sure that this extension is what you are looking for before spending your valuable **time** on it.

## About The Extension

This extension is all about creating the Prettier configuration file `.prettierrc`, with configurations that you must create yourself (so you can choose between them while creating the file. 1 configuration is enough!) before you can use this extension.

## Commands

There's only 1 command which is:

* ID: `iap-p.create`
* Name: `IAP Create Prettierrc`

## Configurations

There's 3 available configurations you can set to customize the behavior of the extension:

> `iap-p.tabSize`
>
> **Type**: *Integer* (between 0 and 10) &nbsp; • &nbsp; **Default**: 2
>
> A *tabSize* of 0 will put all the content in a single line!

> `iap-p.configs`
>
> **Type**: *Object*
>
> Here you will define the different *configurations* that you will choose between while creating the file.

> `iap-p.alwaysOverwrite`
>
> **Type**: *Boolean* &nbsp; • &nbsp; **Default**: False
>
> Always Overwrite the file content without asking (if the file already exists).

## The End

Thank you for exploring the extension!
